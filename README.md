# earthquake-app
This simple web app displays all recorded earthquakes worldwide from the last 15 minutes. All data is collected from the 
United States Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program API. Here is a link to the API Documentation:

The earthquake app uses the Bulma CSS framework to display each event in tiles.
