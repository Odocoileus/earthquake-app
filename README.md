# earthquake-app
This simple web app displays all recorded earthquakes worldwide from the last 15 minutes. All data is collected from the 
United States Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program API. Here is a link to the API Documentation: 
  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

The earthquake app uses the Bulma CSS framework to display each event in tiles.

CHANGES:

-Entirely new styling, using Bulma to put each event into a tile

(11/03/2017)
-Tiles now display from left to right in sets of three.

-All tiles now display different data. Styling updated. The code now displays whatever tiles that were not diaplayed in threes in a <div> with a unique ID so that it can be centered below the other tiles.
